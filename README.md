1. [Enviroment]

    a. Apache/2.4.33 - PHP/7.2.4 (mod_php7)
    b. Xdebug v2.6.0 

2. [Installation]

    The only thing that needs, is to unzip and copy the folder "AngelosKanatsos" in the Apache Document Root. The right path is AngelosKanatsos/XM/PHP/ ... /projectfolders/projectfiles

3. [Resources]

    All resources/dependecies exist inside the project folder, even the composer vendor, has already installed the swift mailer. Deliberately none CDN was used for the resources. Everything is located in AngelosKanatsos folder and is ready for running.

4. [Testing]

    Unfortunately, time did not allow me to anticipate its implementation. I didn't manage my time properly as it turned out. I am sorry about that.
